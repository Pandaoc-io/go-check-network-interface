It check the interface oper/admin status and all the stats below :
- In/out Bandwidth in bps/%
- In/Out Errors in pps/%
- In/Out Discards in pps/%
- Half/Full duplex

It will also grap some additional informations like:
- Speed of the interface (Mb)
- Interface description also know as Alias
- Nb of pps per flow type in In/Out (Unicast/Multicast/Broadcast)
